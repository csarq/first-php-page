# My First PHP Project 

This is my first ever PHP project - I wanted to learn some basics of PHP for a job application.  
You can view it [here.](https://first-php-page.zeabur.app/)

**What does it do?**

This project uses PHP to fetch information about the next Marvel movie from an API. It was a simple way to learn about how PHP can work with external data sources and display the results. 

## How It Works

I've actually left two files in this repo:

1. **index.php:** This is the star of the show!
   *  a request is made to the Marvel API which gets a response in JSON format.
   *  the JSON is turned into something PHP can understand using the ```json_decode()``` function..
   *  PHP, HTML & CSS is used to create a simple webpage that includes the film information (title, poster, etc.).
3. **practicing.php:** This was the PHP playground from the beginning of the tutorial for getting some familiarity with the language. It includes variables, constants, a match expression, an array and a foreach loop.

To build this project I followed this great tutorial in Spanish: [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/BcGAPkjt_IE?si=Qj6f5YXFupBNajZz).
